### Description
This package implements a few algorithms for association rule mining and sequential pattern mining. In particular, we have currently implemented the _Apriori_ algorithm and the SPADE algorithm. The former is useful for association rule mining (e.g., "market basket" analysis), and the latter is useful for identifying sequential patterns when the data possess a temporal ordering. The algorithms are written in pure Julia. 


Note that a portion of our implementation of the _a_ _priori_ algorithm was adapted from the earlier work of [toddleo](https://github.com/toddleo/ARules.jl).


### Initial Setup
```{Julia}
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/paulstey/assocation_rules")
```

### Examples
Here we are generating association rules using `apriori()` function.
```{Julia}
using AssociationRules

# simulate transactions
groceries = ["milk", "bread", "eggs", "apples", "oranges", "beer"]
transactions = [sample(groceries, 4, replace = false) for x in 1:1000]

# minimum support of 0.1, minimum confidence of 0.4
rules1 = apriori(transactions, 0.1, 0.4)
```


Note that by default our `apriori()` function generates multi-item consequents. However, it can be made to mimic the `apriori()` function in R's _arules_ package and generate only single-item consequents.
```{Julia}
groceries = ["milk", "bread", "eggs", "apples", "oranges", "beer"]
transactions = [sample(groceries, 4, replace = false) for x in 1:1000]

# fourth argument prevents multi-item consequents
rules1 = apriori(transactions, 0.1, 0.4, false)
```


We can also use the `frequent()` function to generate the frequent item sets based on some minimum support threshold. Note that this function is called internally by the `apriori()` function when generating association rules.
```{Julia}
groceries = ["milk", "bread", "eggs", "apples", "oranges", "beer"]
transactions = [sample(groceries, 4, replace = false) for x in 1:1000]

# item sets with minimum support of 0.1
fk = frequent(transactions, 0.1)
```


### Current Algorithms
- _Apriori_ Algortihm (Agrawal & Srikant, 1994)
- SPADE Algorithm (Zaki, 2001)


### In progress
- Sequential rule induction algorithm based on prefix trees
- Update _Apriori_ to take advantage of multi-threaded parallelism


### To do
- FP-growth algorithm for association rules
- Add measures of interestingness for rules generated by the _Apriori_ algorithm

### _Caveats_
- The current rule-induction algorithm for sequential patterns runs in exponential time, and thus, is both slow and memory inefficient.
- This package is under active development. Please notify us of bugs or proposed improvements by submitting an issue or pull request.
