### Description
This package implements a few algorithms for association rule mining and sequential pattern mining algorithms in pure Julia. In particular, we have currently implemented the _a_ _priori_ algorithm and the SPADE algorithm. The former is useful for association rule mining (e.g., "market basket" analysis), and the latter is useful for identifying sequential patterns when the data possess a temporal ordering.

Note that a portion of our implementation of the _a_ _priori_ algorithm was adapted from the earlier work of [toddleo](https://github.com/toddleo/ARules.jl).


### Initial Setup
```{Julia}
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/paulstey/assocation_rules")
```

### Examples


### Current Algorithms
- _a_ _priori_ Algortihm (Agrawal & Srikant, 1994)
- SPADE Algorithm (Zaki, 2001)


### To Do
- Rule induction algorithm based on prefix trees
- FP-growth algorithm for association rules
- Add measures of interestingness for rules generated by the _a_ _priori_ algorithm

### _Caveats_
- The current rule-induction algorithm runs in exponential time, and thus, is both slow and memory inefficient.
- This package is under active development. Please notify us of bugs or proposed improvements by submitting an issue or pull request.
