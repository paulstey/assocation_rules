### Description
This package implements a few algorithms for association rule mining and sequential pattern mining algorithms in pure Julia. In particular, we have currently implemented the _a_ _priori_ algorithm and the SPADE algorithm. The former is useful for association rule mining (e.g., "market basket" analysis), and the latter is useful for identifying sequential patterns when the data possess a temporal ordering.


Note that a portion of our implementation of the _a_ _priori_ algorithm was adapted from the earlier work of [toddleo](https://github.com/toddleo/ARules.jl).


### Initial Setup
```{Julia}
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/paulstey/assocation_rules")
```

### Examples
Generating association rules using `apriori()` function
```{Julia}
using AssociationRules

# simulate transactions
groceries = ["milk", "bread", "eggs", "apples", "oranges", "beer"]
transactions = [sample(groceries, 4, replace = false) for x in 1:1000]

# generate rules with minimum support of 0.1, and minimum confidence of 0.4
rules1 = aprior(transactions, 0.1, 0.4)
```


Note that by default our `aprior()` function generates multi-item consequents. However, it can be made to mimic R's arules package and generate only single-item consequents.
```{Julia}
groceries = ["milk", "bread", "eggs", "apples", "oranges", "beer"]
transactions = [sample(groceries, 4, replace = false) for x in 1:1000]

# fourth argument prevents multi-item consequents
rules1 = aprior(transactions, 0.1, 0.4, false)
```


We can also use the `frequent()` function to generate the frequent item sets based on some minimum support threshold. This function is run internally when calling the `apriori()` function.
```{Julia}
groceries = ["milk", "bread", "eggs", "apples", "oranges", "beer"]
transactions = [sample(groceries, 4, replace = false) for x in 1:1000]

# derive frequent item sets with minimum support of 0.1
fk = frequent(transactions, 0.1)
```


### Current Algorithms
- _a_ _priori_ Algortihm (Agrawal & Srikant, 1994)
- SPADE Algorithm (Zaki, 2001)


### In progress
- Sequential rule induction algorithm based on prefix trees
- Update _a_ _priori_ to take advantage of multi-threaded parallelism


### To do
- FP-growth algorithm for association rules
- Add measures of interestingness for rules generated by the _a_ _priori_ algorithm

### _Caveats_
- The current rule-induction algorithm runs in exponential time, and thus, is both slow and memory inefficient.
- This package is under active development. Please notify us of bugs or proposed improvements by submitting an issue or pull request.
